# Mapping-Career-Opportunities

Career guidance faces challenges in aligning student skills with evolving job markets. This project addresses these gaps by integrating geospatial, temporal, and skillset analysis to empower stakeholders with actionable insights. Prior work in career analytics emphasizes static dashboards, but this project innovates by combining AI-driven prototyping (DeepSeek, DALL-E) with interactive Power BI tools to enhance decision-making for students and counselors.
